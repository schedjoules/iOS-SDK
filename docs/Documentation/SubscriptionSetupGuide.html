<h2>Submit auto-renewable subscriptions to Connect</h2>

<p>It's not possible to use Apple's Application Uploader to add subscriptions to Connect, so you manually have to add auto-renewable subscriptions to Connect.</p>

<p>To get the information you need to enter in Connect go to:</p>

<pre><code>curl 'https://api.schedjoules.com/apps/renewable_subscriptions.html' -v -H 'Authorization: Token token="{YOUR_API_KEY}"'
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively you can visit <a href="https://api.schedjoules.com/apps/renewable">https://api.schedjoules.com/apps/renewable</a>_subscriptions for the JSON representation.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare your app for auto-renewable subscriptions:</strong>
* Go to iTunes Connect
* Select the app you want to add subscriptions to
* Make sure you have a privacy policy in place and add the link to it. You can use ours as an example <a href="http://www.schedjoules.com/privacy-policy/">http://www.schedjoules.com/privacy-policy/</a>
* Press &lsquo;Features&rsquo; in top bar. You are now on the In-App Purchases tab
* Press &lsquo;View Shared Secret&rsquo; and send that secret to us. We&rsquo;ll use it to validate the purchase and expiration date of the subscription</p>

<p><strong>Add auto-renewable subscription to Connect:</strong>
* Press &lsquo;+&rsquo; to add an IAP
* Select &lsquo;Automatically Renewable Subscriptionsâ€™
* Enter the information you find on <a href="https://api.schedjoules.com/apps/renewable_subscriptions.html.">https://api.schedjoules.com/apps/renewable_subscriptions.html.</a>

<p>NOTES:
* The identifier can&rsquo;t be changed in Connect, so if you make an error here, let us know so we can update our side.
* You can find the alternate pricing tiers at the bottom of the Price Tier dropdown.
* You only need to add the languages your app is targeted to</p>

<h2>Launch auto-renewable subscriptions in the Store</h2>

<p>Your application description needs to meet the terms and conditions for auto-renewing subscriptions, as specified in Schedule 2, Section 3.8(b). Meeting the terms of this agreement is required by the App Store Review Guidelines.</p>

<p>Specifically, your Application Description has to include:</p>

<ol>
<li>the length of the subscription</li>
<li>the price of the subscription</li>
<li>links to the privacy policy and terms of use</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Add the following text at the end of your Application Description</strong></p>

<p><em>Access to Calendar Store for 1 year</em><br/>
<em>With a yearly subscription you get full and ongoing access to the Calendar Store including (live) updates in your calendar. A subscription always starts with a one-month free trial, so you can try before you buy. 1 year subscriptions for the Calendar Store start at $0.99. Payment will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase and after the 1 month free trial. Subscriptions automatically renew unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. Your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current 1 year period. You can turn off auto-renew at any time from your iTunes account settings. Cancellation of the current active subscription period is not allowed.</em></p>

<p><em>Find the full terms and conditions, and our privacy policy, at [url] and [url] respectively.</em></p>

<p>NOTE: Please be sure to add this text to all App Localizations by selecting each specific localization and making appropriate changes.</p>

<p><strong>Add text to Notes field for Apple Editors</strong></p>

<p>Click &lsquo;Prepare for Submission&rsquo; and add the following text to the Notes field under &lsquo;App Review Information&rsquo; to request Apple to disable the &ldquo;Share Your Information&rdquo; dialog" in the subscription purchase flow:</p>

<p><em>I hereby want to request to disable the &ldquo;Share Your Information&rdquo; dialog for our application ID [NUMBER]. In your documentation you also state that there&rsquo;s an option for Auto Renewing subscriptions to &ldquo;Offer a marketing opt-in incentived&rdquo; - yes/no. This setting controls whether the user will be provided a bonus free period for sharing their information. This option is not available however.</em></p>
